# NMEA2K

`nmea2k` is a Ruby project designed for receiving and transmitting messages
on an NMEA 2000 bus.

Makes use of the PGN database from the
[canboat](https://github.com/canboat/canboat) project.

Currently has drivers only for the Yacht Devices NMEA 2000 gateway.
Introducing additional drivers should be pretty straightforward.

Requires Ruby 2.6.3 or later.
